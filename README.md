   <p align="center">Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. </p>



## Gameplay
A sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult.
